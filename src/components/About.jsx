        I have strong skills in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), and I am building my knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) at a beginner level. I am continuously improving my problem-solving skills and am excited to take on more challenging projects in web development and software engineering.

        I am passionate about developing full-stack applications and always eager to take on more challenging projects to enhance my technical skills. Currently, I’m focused on improving my DSA abilities to become a more well-rounded software developer
